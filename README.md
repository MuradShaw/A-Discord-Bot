A Discord bot that needs a new name

# A Discord Bot's Vision <br>
A Discord Bot's main goal is to easily connect to mysql servers such as forums and websites, and intergrate that into a discord server. For example, does your forum have private messaging? By connecting A Discord Bot to your site's mysql database, you can have your forum's private messages be relayed on discord via direct message as well.

Keep in mind, A Discord Bot is being made alongside my own forum software, Citra, and is built around that. However, it should be easy enough to configure your site to work with A Discord Bot.
